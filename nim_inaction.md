#Programming 
## Nim Reference
```nim
const x = 5 # Compile-time constant
let y = "hello" # Immutable binding
var z = [1,2,3] # Mutable variable
```


The nim compiler transaltes nim code into C code, like python, but its almost as fast as C, and 13 times faster than Python apps

Nim also has metaprogramming, this allows you to read, generate, analyze and transform source code by abstracting from syntax, for example tes_function and tesFunction will be the same for the Nim compiler
